This project is a combination of a couple tutorials and personal ideas. I chose to use emojis as the hand objects for the game rather than use text. I also added a restart button that appears after the conclusion of the game when a player has won three rounds. 
It was quite challenging organizing the function and event listeners in an order that made sense. MY variable names are all over the place as well. I would find that in order to access a variable farther down in my code that I'd have to remove it from its original function into a global state. Not sure if a few of those instances could have been done neater, but I managed to get functions working this way.
I need to spend more time actively thinking about the layout of my projects next time around. Nevertheless, this turned out being a great project for googling help and structuring a game.
